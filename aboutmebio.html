			<u>About Me</u>
			<br>
			<br>
			My goal as an artist is to understand why people function the way they do and the purposes they serve within communities that they within. Art has the tendency to gather people of similar mindsets, as it is the access point to the next personâ€™s psyche. Everyone has their own reason to exist within the realm of art, and I believe through understanding of others, my purpose is to assist those around me in their own awareness. Communities around art have helped me gain the confidence to synthesize my personal world view and reform premature ideas into sophisticated realizations. Communities allow an access point to learn, but also to be heard. I create art to understand myself and speak, but therefore help others understand themselves.

			<u>Bio</u>
			<br>
			<br>
			Tony Tirador is a music business / management major at Berklee College of Music of the class of 2018. With 8 years of experience in studying orchestral percussion and 11 years in classical piano, Tony entered the school with the North American Tour Scholarship and the Lester Lanin Scholarship.
			<br><br>
			In Tony's first semester at Berklee, Tony started his deep dive into experimental electronic music and the live electronic space. Tony tried his hand at creating his own electronic music and started playing out live. He quickly became consumed in the visceral, surreal nature of electronic music, and this passion created a significant mark for the various ventures that would soon follow. The following fall, Tony's third semester at Berklee, Tony found himself surrounded by a multitude of musicians, filmmakers, and all artists alike. To support the community, Tony started his multimedia platform, Steady Grounds - a project that includes booking / promoting shows with the intention of filming HQ content for the artists featured. The videos were heavily stylized, creating a brand name and image for Steady Grounds. The audiences for these shows and videos grew exponentially, serving students from various schools in the greater Boston Area. Shows started to pop up across Boston, ranging from DIY basement venues across Allston to live on-air sessions at WHRB in Harvard Square. As attention to the project caught momentum, Tony was featured by Tufts' premier journal of music, Melisma Magazine, in a piece about Steady Grounds. This year, Steady Grounds put out a 15-track compilation comprised of archived audio from the first year of shows. Proceeds were then donated to funding ACLU and Planned Parenthood - League of Massachusetts.

			In 2015, Tony became involved in the marketing department at The Red Room at Cafe 939. Tony started out as a street team runner, shortly made his way to become a promotions and marketing assistant, and eventually was promoted to be a supervisor. As a promotions and marketing supervisor, Tony holds the responsibility to manage a team with the goal of maximizing visibility and audience attendance for events held at the venue, and in turn, promoting the brand name of The Red Room. In 2016, Tony was awarded the Vendini Scholarship - an award that recognizes success in student employment.
			<br><br>
			In 2016, Tony Tirador was selected as a member to the newly instated Berklee Popular Music Institute. As a three semester course, Tony and his classmates selected 6 artists from the school to represent Berklee at major music festivals throughout the United States and Canada in summer 2017. Tony was assigned to electronic music artist Flakes, and helped cultivate his artistry in preparation for a performance at WayHome Festival in Toronto, Canada. Following the successful show, Tony followed the institute to Lollapalooza where he participated in running full-fledged interactive musical experience for kids at the subset, Kidzapolooza. With the support of his professor Jeff Dorenfeld, Tony Tirador was awarded the Music Business / Marketing Scholarship.
			<br><br>
			In Summer 2017, Tony Tirador was selected out of a pool of 100+ students from around the world to participate in the Open Music Initiative's Summer Lab as a research fellow. Along with 20 unique fellows, a mix software developers, visual artists, and musicians, Tony explored the technical challenges of music distribution and artist compensation in the digital age. Tony was given the challenge of cataloging, attributing, and distributing live DJ mixes and placed in the team, Team NotTomatoLovers. By the end of the fellowship, Team NotTomatoLovers designed and developed a new music experience at live DJ performances that allows for distinct emotional moments in a performance to be captured and analysed for artists and businesses involved in the music industry to understand the core values of a live performance.

			<u>The Red Room at Cafe 939</u>
			<br>
			<br>
			In September 2015, I began work for The Red Room at Cafe 939 as a street team runner. I was promoted shortly thereafter to promotions and marketing, and eventually to promotions and marketing  supervisor. My goal as promotions and marketing supervisor is to maximize visibility and work to increase audience attendance for events held at the renowned Berklee College of Music concert venue, and in turn promoting the brand name. I extensively advertise these shows I am assigned through variety of creative marketing and manage a promotions team whom help me do so. Through this job, I apply wide variety of skills - including professional business communication, managerial techniques, photoshop, and live event photography.

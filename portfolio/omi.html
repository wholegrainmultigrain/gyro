			<u>Open Music Initiative Summer Lab 2017</u>
			<br>
			<br>
			The Open Music Initiative Summer Lab is an eight week research fellowship from June 5 to July 28 hosted by globally renowned innovation and design firm, IDEO, and Berklee College of Musicâ€™s landmark entrepreneurial program, BerkleeICE. Four teams were challenged to envision a future for music and its industry through the lens of human-centered design, distributed ledgers, and the OMI API. Sallie Xu, Michelle Wu, Mitzi Okou, Jonathan Koh and myself assemble as Team NotTomatoLovers and we were given the brief of cataloging, attributing, and distributing live DJ mixes.
